Project Description
MVVM Framework is a set of base implementation of MVVM principles and components helping to quick and efficient develop WPF business applications.

The MVVM Framework makes it easier to develop WPF applications using the Model-View-ViewModel design pattern. It covers three different layers.
Features

    Different view models
    Amazing implementation of INotifyPropertyChanged
    Basic view layer
    Binding converters
    And other useful classes, approaches and MVVM features

The MVVMFramework.View library contains a base implementation of Window. This realization contains basic communication with view model, such as closing Window by view model request.
Also this library contains value converters you can use to data-binding operations.
